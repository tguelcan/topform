# svelte top form

Topform is a form generator for Sveltekit. It was created out of the motivation to make forms easily available with as little effort and as much consistency as possible, thus minimizing operational overhead. It is currently in the development phase. Significant changes are subject to change.<br />
The focus is to provide a form that follows the HTML standard. Therefore, it can be well combined or used with the example described by SvelteKit.<br />
Topform is designed as an open source project. Everyone is invited to contribute.
